# Web App with Aurora MySQL Connection

This repository contains the screenshots, and documentation on how to connect a web application to an **Amazon Aurora MySQL** database using **EC2**. 

## Project Overview

In this project, I demonstrate how to:
- Spin up an **Amazon Aurora MySQL Database** from scratch.
- Connect the Aurora database to an **EC2 instance**.
- Build and install a basic **web application** on the EC2 instance.
- Upgrade the web app to connect directly to the **Aurora MySQL Database**.
- Test and verify the database interactions using **MySQL CLI**.
